    <h1>Panda Conservation</h1>
    <section id="about" class="info">
        <h2>About Pandas</h2>
        <p>Pandas are a bear species native to China, famous for their distinctive black and white fur. They are known for their calm and playful nature. Pandas primarily eat bamboo, which makes up over 99% of their diet, and they are solitary animals with a relatively low reproduction rate.</p>
        <div class="status">
            <p>Status: <strong>Vulnerable</strong></p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="habitat">
        <h2>Habitat</h2>
        <p>Pandas are found in the mountainous regions of central China, primarily in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They inhabit dense bamboo forests at altitudes ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters. These forests provide the bamboo they rely on for sustenance and the cover needed for their survival.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <div>
                <h3>Geographical Range</h3>
                <p>Pandas are endemic to China, with their range shrinking due to habitat fragmentation and human activities. Conservation efforts are focused on preserving and expanding these critical habitats.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Climate and Terrain</h3>
                <p>The terrain consists of steep slopes and deep valleys, with a cool and moist climate that is ideal for bamboo growth. The dense vegetation provides the necessary camouflage and shelter for pandas from predators.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="diet">
        <h2>Diet</h2>
        <p>Pandas are primarily herbivores, with bamboo making up over 99% of their diet. Despite being classified as carnivores, pandas have a specialized digestive system adapted to a bamboo diet. They consume large quantities of bamboo daily, spending up to 12 hours eating.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <div>
                <h3>Bamboo Consumption</h3>
                <p>A panda eats around 26 to 84 pounds of bamboo per day. Their diet also includes small mammals, birds, and carrion, but bamboo is the staple of their diet.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Feeding Habits</h3>
                <p>Pandas use their strong jaw muscles and teeth to crush the bamboo stalks. They prefer young, tender bamboo shoots, which are more nutritious and easier to digest.</p>
            </div>

    <section id="conservation">
        <h2>Conservation Efforts</h2>
        <p>Panda conservation has been a significant focus for wildlife organizations globally. Efforts include habitat protection, breeding programs, and community engagement to reduce human-wildlife conflict.</p>
        <div class="content">
            <div>
                <h3>Protected Areas</h3>
                <p>China has established several nature reserves and national parks dedicated to panda conservation, such as the Wolong National Nature Reserve and the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuary.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Breeding Programs</h3>
                <p>Breeding programs in captivity have successfully increased panda numbers. The Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding is one of the most successful programs, contributing to the species' recovery.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Community Involvement</h3>
                <p>Local communities are crucial in conservation efforts. Programs are in place to provide alternative livelihoods and raise awareness about the importance of pandas and their habitats.</p>

            <div>
                <h3>Unique Black and White Coloring</h3>
                <p>The distinctive black and white fur of pandas helps them blend into the forest environment, providing excellent camouflage against predators.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Specialized Paws</h3>
                <p>Pandas have an extra "thumb," a modified wrist bone that acts like a thumb, allowing them to grasp bamboo stalks effectively.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Low Reproduction Rate</h3>
                <p>Female pandas have a short estrus cycle, making breeding challenging. Conservationists use artificial insemination and breeding programs to boost panda populations.</p>
